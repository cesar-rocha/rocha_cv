%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section

% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP

% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines

%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
